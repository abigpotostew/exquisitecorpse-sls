Technical:
- CORS on image bucket in sls
- [x] config per environment -- my.config.yaml
- [x] usage plan per env!! - did throttling on the stage
- certificate from serverless

Features:
- hotkeys
- instructions improvements
    - inform people they cannot see the other sections until it is complete. (use UX to obfuscate the other drawing. Maybe blurring it??
- Update instead of create new upon section changes after generating a url!
- UX: loading icons
- Gallery view

Bugs:
- [x] the img src loads after the sketch loads
- Can draw when the cursor is off screen to right on first segment.
    - bigger since it draws a huge line across screen when you go off screen.
