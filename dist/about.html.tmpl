            <p>
                Exquisite corpse is a collaborative art game in which a piece of paper is folded into segments and filled in by multiple artists. Each section is completed without knowing what the other artists have drawn. Hint lines connect each section so the "corpse" is continuous. After the last section is complete, the paper is unfolded and revealed to all.
            </p>

                Typically the game is played with three sections so that a head, torso, and legs are drawn by three different people.

                I made this digital version of exquisite corpse for all to enjoy the game virtually.
